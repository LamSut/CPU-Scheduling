Write a program to implement the CPU scheduling algorithms: FCFS, SJF-preemptive and Round Robin. The program will take the parameters of n processes. Each scheduler will create a Gantt chart showing the states of the processes in a string format, where R denotes the running state and W denotes the waiting state. Finally, the program will calculate the average values of the waiting time, response time, and turnaround time of each scheduler.
